**hclustext** is a collection of optimized tools for clustering text
data via hierarchical clustering. There are many great R [clustering
tools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Cluster.html) to locate
topics within documents. I have had success with hierarchical clustering
for topic extraction. This package wraps many of the great R tools for
clustering and working with sparse matrices to aide in the workflow
associated with topic extraction.

The general idea is that we turn the documents into a matrix of words.
After this we weight the terms by importance using
[tf-idf](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tf-idf-weighting-1.html).
This helps the more salient words to rise to the top. We then apply
cosine distance measures to compare the terms (or features) of each
document. Cosine distance works well with sparse matrices to produce
distances metrics between the documents. The hierarchical clustering is
fit to separate the documents into clusters. The user then may apply k
clusters to the fit, clustering documents with similar important text
features. The documents can then be grouped by clusters and their
accompanying salient words extracted as well.

Installation
============

To download the development version of **hclustext**:

Download the [zip
ball](https://github.com/trinker/hclustext/zipball/master) or [tar
ball](https://github.com/trinker/hclustext/tarball/master), decompress
and run `R CMD INSTALL` on it, or use the **pacman** package to install
the development version:

    pacman::p_load_gh(
        "trinker/textshape", 
        "trinker/gofastr", 
        "trinker/termco",    
        "trinker/hclustext"
    )

Demonstration
=============

Load Packages and Data
----------------------

    if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
    pacman::p_load(hclustext, dplyr, textshape)

    data(presidential_debates_2012)

Data Structure
--------------

The data structure for **hclustext** is very specific. The
`data_storage` produces a `DocumentTermMatrix` which maps to the
original text. The empty/removed documents are tracked within this data
structure, making subsequent calls to cluster the original documents and
produce weighted important terms more robust. Making the `data_storage`
object is the first step to analysis.

We can give the `DocumentTermMatrix` rownames via the `doc.names`
argument. If these names are not unique they will be combined into a
single document as seen below. Also, if you want to do stemming, minimum
character length, stopword removal or such this is when/where it's done.

    ds <- with(
        presidential_debates_2012,
        data_store(dialogue, doc.names = paste(person, time, sep = "_"))
    )

    ds

    ## Text Elements      : 2,912
    ## Elements Removed   : 0
    ## Documents          : 10
    ## Terms              : 3,369
    ## Non-/sparse entries: 7713/25977
    ## Sparsity           : 77%
    ## Maximal term length: 16

Fit the Model: Hierarchical Cluster
-----------------------------------

Next we can fit a hierarchical cluster model to the `data_store` object
via `hierarchical_cluster`.

    myfit <- hierarchical_cluster(ds)

    myfit

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## fastcluster::hclust(d = cosine_distance(x[["dtm"]]), method = method)
    ## 
    ## Cluster method   : ward.D 
    ## Number of objects: 10

This object can be plotted with various `k` or `h` paremeters specified
to experiment with cutting the dendrogram. This cut will determine the
number of clusters or topics that will be generated in the next step.
The visual inspection allows for determining how to cluster the data as
well as determining if a tf-idf, cosine, hierarchical cluster model is a
right fit for the data and task. By default `plot` uses an approximation
of `k` based on Can & Ozkarahan's (1990) formula (*m* \* *n*)/*t* where
*m* and *n* are the dimensions of the matrix and *t* is the length of
the non-zero elements in matrix *A*.

    cover-coefficient-based clustering methodology for text databases.
    *ACM Transactions on Database Systems 15* (4): 483.
    <doi:10.1145/99935.99938>

Interestingly, in the plots below where `k = 6` clusters, the model
groups each of the candidates together at each of the debate times.

    ## k approximated to: 4

    plot(myfit, h = .75)

    ca <- assign_cluster(myfit, k = 6)

    ca

Putting it Together
-------------------

I like working in a chain. In the setup below we work within a
**magrittr** pipeline to fit a model, select clusters, and examine the
results. In this example I do not condense the 2012 Presidential Debates
data by speaker and timer, rather leaving every sentence as a separate
document. On my machine the initial `data_store` and model fit takes
~5-8 seconds to crun.

    .tic <- Sys.time()

    myfit2 <- presidential_debates_2012 %>%
        with(data_store(dialogue)) %>%
        hierarchical_cluster()

    difftime(Sys.time(), .tic)

    ## Time difference of 7.934837 secs

    ## View Document Loadings
    ca2 <- assign_cluster(myfit2, k = 100)
    summary(ca2)
